# CADFileAdapter

Given the CAD file of a labware object, this repository will automatically generate a CAD (stl) file for an adapter that would allow that object to snap into a rectangle on the the deck of opentron robot. The adapter generated will be attached to the labware object, which alters the size enough to snap into the rectangle on the robot.
